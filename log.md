# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator, couldn't get elements to align, realized I had a lot of unnecessary code. Scrapped code & started over again. Alignments are working, now I just need to format the buttons before adding the Twitter link and the random quote API.

**Thoughts** There will probably be final adjustments to the formatting once the generator is working.
