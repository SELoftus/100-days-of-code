**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS for @freecodecamp's Wikipedia Viewer! Still working on the CSS but the functionality is complete.

**Thoughts**: You would not BELIEVE how long it took me to hunt down the missing ')' that was causing 90% of the problem. The other 10% was a wonky function.

### Day 36: Date: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 12 #javascript30. Still trying to get fullscreen for Day 11 to work - inspecting the code shows that it does respond when the button is clicked, by adding the fullscreen class to the player, but it doesn't actually go fullscreen. Problem occurs on multiple computers & browsers.

**Thoughts**: Conflict with the Shadow DOM? Which is one of the coolest names for a thing ever.

### Day 32: Date: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 8 #Javascript30 (HTML Canvas), jQuery @codecademy, think I've gotten the JS for the @freecodecamp weather app working, at least enough to detect the city.

**Thoughts**: The weather app has been giving me trouble, but it's not more stubborn than I am.

### Day 31: Date: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More jQuery @codecademy, day 7 JS30, worked on weather app for @freecodecamp, practiced drawing shapes with CSS.

**Thoughts**: Definitely needed more of a background in JS than I had, even following FCC's map, to work on the weather app. Need to do some formatting work on the CSS shapes file so it's not just a great long column of shapes.

### Day 27: Date: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Third #JavaScript30 tutorial, updating CSS Variables with JS, + some work with methods & constructors on @codecademy.

**Thoughts**: Following #JavaScript30 is helping make it clearer how HTML, CSS, and JS all interact, plus I really like the idea of CSS variables.

### Day 26: Date: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 2nd #JavaScript30 tutorial, a JS and CSS clock. Managed to eliminate the flicker when the degree the hand(s) are set at rolls over to 0 by removing the transition property. A little more work with JavaScript plus some more basics of OOP on Codecademy again.

**Thoughts**: Now that I've got a better handle on JavaScript I should start back up with FreeCodeCamp again.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first tutorial for #JavaScript 30, the drum kit. Missed a few typos and had to debug but got it running. Worked on some basics of Object Oriented Programming.

**Thoughts**: Using JS to do build an interactive page wasn't as difficult as I worried it would be.

### Day 24: Date: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work with JavaScript objects on @Codecademy. Signed up for #javascript30, 30 JavaScript tutorials in as many days.

**Thoughts**: 30 JavaScript tutorials in as many days doesn't sound nearly as intimidating at this point as it would have six weeks ago.

### Day 21: Date: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript on Codecademy. Missed yesterday because I was sick & so loopy from not sleeping I just could not follow a logical flow.

### Day 20 : Date: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS, for the build your own blog theme and build your own small business website challenges on GA Dash. Some CSS animations and jQuery.

**Thoughts**: The code on dash isn't quite working, but I'm passing the checkpoints. Checked the FB group & it seems some of the tutorials are outdated. Tried disabling some add-ons and clearing the cache, no luck. I'll finish it and if it's still not working move it to CodePen or my local drive and work it out.

### Day 17: Date: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked out a couple of new coding sites (Codewars, Dash, The Odin Project, some others), worked with JavaScript some more, including building the 'rock, paper, scissors' game for Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: The amount of available resources is amazing. Quite a change from teaching myself HTML in '95! 

I'll do more with Codewars once I've got more coding ability to draw on.

### Day 15: Date: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML & CSS lessons on Codecademy, started the Python course. Laid out the basic HTML structure for a new index page for the FreeCodeCamp Portfolio.

### Day 11: Date: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the SCSS lessons at Codecademy. Experimented more with the geolocation and weather APIs for the FreeCodeCamp weather app.

**Thoughts**: SCSS would be REALLY useful for larger sites, since you can create variables and change those then recompile the CSS instead of ctrl+F-ing through a CSS file for everything you need to update.

### Day 10: Date: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Learn JavaScript lessons on Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: That makes a few things I need for the weather app project on FreeCodeCamp clearer, although what I need for that is still more advanced that what I've learned so far. More classes and research.

### Day 9: Date: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Learn HTML and CSS: Part 1 on Codecademy, started Learn JavaScript, revisiting some of the basic concepts.

**Thoughts**: I still plan to finish FreeCodeCamp but Codecademy's explanations are a little more beginner-friendly in a lot of ways.

2.

### Day 8: Date: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Codecademy, reviewing and practicing some basics before tackling their JavaScript lessons. 

**Thoughts**: The weather app is feeling a bit too advanced and I want to get a firmer understaneding of the basics before I go on.

2.

### Day 7: Date: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting the user's geolocation for the Local Weather App for FreeCodeCamp. Looking for a way now to pass the coordinates variable from that API to the OpenWeatherMap API so it will return the user's city and country.

**Thoughts**: I was right; the JavaScript/JSON is much more complex.

**Link(s) to work**

2.

### Day 6: Date: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished formatting and layout for FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather app, started work on adding the functionality using the Weather API & JavaScript button.

**Thoughts**: The HTML & CSS for this one are much simpler but the JavaScript seems much more complex.

### Day 5: Date: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished coding the Random Quote Generator. Planned layout & began coding HTML and CSS for the Local Weather Machine challenge in FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: Date: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the functionality of the quote generator working, including posting to Twitter with a hashtag included. 

**Thoughts**: Just need to get the formatting of the quote text the size I want it, then it's done.

### Day3: Date: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Realigned the elements & played with the appearance more. Went back through the JSON lessons on FreeCodeCamp + API documentation  + forum posts to get something that would work to generate random quotes. Managed to get the random quote part working, though it doesn't format the way I want it to, but not the Twitter button yet.

**Thoughts**: Pseudocoding helped get things sorted, as does commenting the code to indicate which part does what.

### Day 2: Date: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator again, couldn't get the JavaScript to work. Tinkered with it till it crashed the browser, removed the problem code, and tried to figure out why two elements weren't aligning properly - turns out I'd changed the id in the HTML but not the CSS. Oops.

**Thoughts**: I understand what the code needs to do, but I'm super new to JSON so I'm still working out how to translate what needs to happen into the code that will make it happen.

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator, couldn't get elements to align, realized I had a lot of unnecessary code. Scrapped code & started over again. Alignments are working, now I just need to format the buttons before adding the Twitter link and the random quote API.

**Thoughts** There will probably be final adjustments to the formatting once the generator is working.
