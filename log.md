### Day 4: Date: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the functionality of the quote generator working, including posting to Twitter with a hashtag included. 

**Thoughts**: Just need to get the formatting of the quote text the size I want it, then it's done.

### Day3: Date: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Realigned the elements & played with the appearance more. Went back through the JSON lessons on FreeCodeCamp + API documentation  + forum posts to get something that would work to generate random quotes. Managed to get the random quote part working, though it doesn't format the way I want it to, but not the Twitter button yet.

**Thoughts**: Pseudocoding helped get things sorted, as does commenting the code to indicate which part does what.

### Day 2: Date: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator again, couldn't get the JavaScript to work. Tinkered with it till it crashed the browser, removed the problem code, and tried to figure out why two elements weren't aligning properly - turns out I'd changed the id in the HTML but not the CSS. Oops.

**Thoughts**: I understand what the code needs to do, but I'm super new to JSON so I'm still working out how to translate what needs to happen into the code that will make it happen.

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator, couldn't get elements to align, realized I had a lot of unnecessary code. Scrapped code & started over again. Alignments are working, now I just need to format the buttons before adding the Twitter link and the random quote API.

**Thoughts** There will probably be final adjustments to the formatting once the generator is working.
