### Day 17: Date: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked out a couple of new coding sites (Codewars, Dash, The Odin Project, some others), worked with JavaScript some more, including building the 'rock, paper, scissors' game for Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: The amount of available resources is amazing. Quite a change from teaching myself HTML in '95! 

I'll do more with Codewars once I've got more coding ability to draw on.

### Day 16: Date: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Python and JavaScript lessons on Codecademy, plus some HTML and CSS outlined (on paper, during lulls in D&D).

**Thoughts**: I want to finish the JavaScript before I move on to Python.

### Day 15: Date: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML & CSS lessons on Codecademy, started the Python course. Laid out the basic HTML structure for a new index page for the FreeCodeCamp Portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I should do a quick Bootstrap review tomorrow before I begin fleshing out the index page with content & CSS.

### Day 13: Date: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a brief JS animation tutorial from Codecademy (copied to CodePen w/ a comment referencing this so I can study it later). Finished Codecademy's 'Deploy a Website' lesson & uploaded page to Github, began HTML & CSS. Started revamp of FreeCodeCamp portfolio page to make better use of Bootstrap & reduce code bloat.

### Day 12: Date: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Sass and Make a Website lessons on Codecademy. I think that last was estimated at 3 hours, I did it in less than one.

### Day 11: Date: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the SCSS lessons at Codecademy. Experimented more with the geolocation and weather APIs for the FreeCodeCamp weather app.

**Thoughts**: SCSS would be REALLY useful for larger sites, since you can create variables and change those then recompile the CSS instead of ctrl+F-ing through a CSS file for everything you need to update.

### Day 10: Date: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Learn JavaScript lessons on Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: That makes a few things I need for the weather app project on FreeCodeCamp clearer, although what I need for that is still more advanced that what I've learned so far. More classes and research.

### Day 9: Date: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Learn HTML and CSS: Part 1 on Codecademy, started Learn JavaScript, revisiting some of the basic concepts.

**Thoughts**: I still plan to finish FreeCodeCamp but Codecademy's explanations are a little more beginner-friendly in a lot of ways.

### Day 8: Date: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Codecademy, reviewing and practicing some basics before tackling their JavaScript lessons. 

**Thoughts**: The weather app is feeling a bit too advanced and I want to get a firmer understaneding of the basics before I go on.

### Day 7: Date: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting the user's geolocation for the Local Weather App for FreeCodeCamp. Looking for a way now to pass the coordinates variable from that API to the OpenWeatherMap API so it will return the user's city and country.

**Thoughts**: I was right; the JavaScript/JSON is much more complex.

### Day 6: Date: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished formatting and layout for FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather app, started work on adding the functionality using the Weather API & JavaScript button.

**Thoughts**: The HTML & CSS for this one are much simpler but the JavaScript seems much more complex.

### Day 4: Date: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the functionality of the quote generator working, including posting to Twitter with a hashtag included. 

**Thoughts**: Just need to get the formatting of the quote text the size I want it, then it's done.

### Day3: Date: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Realigned the elements & played with the appearance more. Went back through the JSON lessons on FreeCodeCamp + API documentation  + forum posts to get something that would work to generate random quotes. Managed to get the random quote part working, though it doesn't format the way I want it to, but not the Twitter button yet.

**Thoughts**: Pseudocoding helped get things sorted, as does commenting the code to indicate which part does what.

### Day 2: Date: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator again, couldn't get the JavaScript to work. Tinkered with it till it crashed the browser, removed the problem code, and tried to figure out why two elements weren't aligning properly - turns out I'd changed the id in the HTML but not the CSS. Oops.

**Thoughts**: I understand what the code needs to do, but I'm super new to JSON so I'm still working out how to translate what needs to happen into the code that will make it happen.

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator, couldn't get elements to align, realized I had a lot of unnecessary code. Scrapped code & started over again. Alignments are working, now I just need to format the buttons before adding the Twitter link and the random quote API.

**Thoughts** There will probably be final adjustments to the formatting once the generator is working.
