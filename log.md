# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator again, couldn't get the JavaScript to work. Tinkered with it till it crashed the browser, removed the problem code, and tried to figure out why two elements weren't aligning properly - turns out I'd changed the id in the HTML but not the CSS. Oops.

**Thoughts**: I understand what the code needs to do, but I'm super new to JSON so I'm still working out how to translate what needs to happen into the code that will make it happen.

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator, couldn't get elements to align, realized I had a lot of unnecessary code. Scrapped code & started over again. Alignments are working, now I just need to format the buttons before adding the Twitter link and the random quote API.

**Thoughts** There will probably be final adjustments to the formatting once the generator is working.
