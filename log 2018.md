### Day 7: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Personal Portfolio project @freeCodeCamp. Added a collapsible navar and fixed the layout issues at smaller screen sizes.

**Thoughts** Turns out the layout issues at smaller screen sizes were layout-based not code-based. Changing the cards in the Project section from 30 to 40 percent fixed the problem.
